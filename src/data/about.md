# Intro

I am Shamitha Gowra, a passionate computer science graduate student at [Colorado State University](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/). I have a deep interest in creating scalable and maintainable web applications, implementing innovative machine learning solutions, and solving complex problems across various industries. Currently, I am seeking full-time roles that align with my expertise and enthusiasm for software development, AI, and computer vision.

In addition to my technical work, I enjoy organizing and programming events at CSU through my role as an Event Programmer for [Ram Events](https://lsc.colostate.edu/sli/events-at-csu/ram-events/), where I help foster community engagement through concerts, cultural events, and more.

# My Journey

- I graduated with a [B.Tech in Electronics and Communication](https://www.anu.ac.in/) from Acharya Nagarjuna University in 2019, after which I worked as a Software Engineer at [Nalsoft](https://nalsoft.com/), where I led end-to-end implementations of cloud-based enterprise solutions.
- I joined the [MS in Computer Science program](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/grad/ms-programs/) at Colorado State University, expected to graduate in December 2024, to further deepen my understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.
- I’ve developed robust web applications, designed SQL databases, and optimized user interfaces during my tenure as a Web Application Designer at CSU.
- My technical skills include proficiency in Python, Java, C++, and C#, as well as frameworks like Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. My soft skills in leadership, teamwork, and communication have enabled me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.

# Projects I’m Proud Of

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: I implemented five machine learning algorithms from scratch, optimizing for performance by comparing results with scikit-learn implementations.
- **Portfolio Management Using RNNs**: I modeled stock price movements using LSTMs and analyzed the trade-offs between high returns and volatility versus more stable strategies.
- **Gesture Recognition System**: I developed a hand gesture recognition system leveraging computer vision and machine learning, overcoming challenges like dynamic background removal and varying lighting conditions.

# I Enjoy

- Organizing and planning community events at CSU.
- Writing poems and maintaining a [creative blog](https://www.instagram.com/poshetry/).
- Staying curious about the latest trends in AI, web development, and computer science.
